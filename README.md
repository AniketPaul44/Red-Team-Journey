# 🛡️ Red Teaming Journey – Aniket Paul

Welcome to my red teaming learning journal.

I'm a 3rd-year BA.LLB student with a deep passion for cybersecurity and offensive security. While I study law during the day, I dive into ethical hacking, Active Directory attacks, and red team strategy in my spare time.

This repository is a collection of everything I’ve learned and practiced as I work toward becoming a professional red teamer. From TryHackMe labs and tool usage to simulated red team operations — it's all here.
