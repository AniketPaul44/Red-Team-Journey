## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- **Planning is everything**: Real red teaming isn’t just tools — it’s about planning, communication, and safety.
- **Legal awareness**: Having a law background helped me understand the importance of RoE and ethical limitations.
- **Documentation is key**: A clean report builds credibility even for student hackers.
